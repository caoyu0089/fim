A) GA-Apriori and PSO-Apriori Implementations: 

GA-Apriori.cpp and PSO-Apriori.cpp present the C++ Implementation of GA-Apriori and PSO-Apriori approaches. 


B) To run the implementation: 

1- Keep project files in one folder.

2- Compile GA-Apriori.cpp and PSO-Apriori.cpp 

3- run using following command:

(For Linux/Mac)

./GA-Apriori.cpp and PSO-Apriori.cpp

(For Windows)

GA-Apriori.exe  and PSO-Apriori.exe
 
D) About input data
The input data should be available in a textfile (.txt). To load the data into the program, you have to modify the name of 
the file in the function read_trans(), in particulary in the function fopen().
